# Railway Quick Start - Fixed Commands

Based on the Railway CLI version you're using, here are the corrected commands:

## 1. Initialize Project
```bash
railway init
# Select workspace and give your project a name
```

## 2. Add Database
```bash
railway add --database postgres
# ✅ This worked correctly
```

## 3. Set Environment Variables

**Railway CLI doesn't have a `variables set` command**. Use the dashboard instead:

### Method 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://railway.com/project/9b11789a-19d4-45b9-85c7-f7dd5cd58725
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Add these variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
   SESSION_SECRET=LGyYd4-eQv4f-vVim3wA7_R1SHSJ4KfTYApc_afvYFPT3BlbkFJsJNhd7GEw16NI9q6SQQC3RjO56hOKgsXhG
   APP_URL=https://probo-ms-dev.railway.app
   S3_BUCKET=probod-ms-dev
   ```

### Method 2: Check CLI Version
```bash
railway --version
railway variables --help
```

Some Railway CLI versions might support:
```bash
railway env set KEY=value
```

## 4. Deploy
```bash
railway up
```

## 5. Check Status
```bash
railway status
railway logs
```

## Required Environment Variables

Add these in Railway Dashboard:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...  # Auto-generated by Railway PostgreSQL
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...     # Your OpenAI API key
SESSION_SECRET=...             # Long random string (32+ chars)
APP_URL=https://...railway.app # Your Railway app URL
S3_BUCKET=probod               # S3 bucket name
```

## Optional Variables
```
S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.amazonaws.com
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
LOG_LEVEL=info
```
